## Hate Speech Detection

### Goal 🎯
The main goal of the project was to develop a deep learning model that accurately identifies and classifies hate speech in text data and to help identify and filter harmful language, promoting safer and more respectful online interactions.

### Model(s) used for the Web App 🧮
The application uses a TensorFlow model with BERT for binary classification of hate speech vs non-hate speech. The model produces probabilities between 0-1, with 0.5 as the decision threshold.
