We have used EDA to display the following:
1. Distirbution of Lung Cancer Density by Age
2. Used plots to display the count of "yes" and "no"s by various parameters
3. Used barcharts to see if SMOTE is needed
4. Use corelation heatmaps to see dependence of various columns (as it approaches 1, we get more positive correlation)
