# Good Coding Practices üßë‚Äçüíª

1. **Follow the Project's Code Style**

   - Maintain consistency with the existing code style (indentation, spacing, comments).
   - Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
   - Keep functions short and focused on a single task.
   - Avoid hardcoding values; instead, use constants or configuration files when possible.

2. **Write Clear and Concise Comments**

   - Use comments to explain why you did something, not just what you did.
   - Avoid unnecessary comments that state the obvious.
   - Document complex logic and functions with brief explanations to help others understand your thought -process.

3. **Keep Code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**

   - Avoid duplicating code. Reuse functions, methods, and components whenever possible.
   - If you find yourself copying and pasting code, consider creating a new function or component.

4. **Write Tests**

   - Write unit tests for your functions and components.
   - Ensure your tests cover both expected outcomes and edge cases.
   - Run tests locally before making a pull request to make sure your changes don‚Äôt introduce new bugs.

5. **Code Reviews and Feedback**

   - Be open to receiving constructive feedback from other contributors.
   - Conduct code reviews for others and provide meaningful suggestions to improve the code.
   - Always refactor your code based on feedback to meet the project's standards.

<br>

# Note: üî®

> - Do not edit/delete someone else's code in this repository. You can only insert new files/folder in this repository.

  > - Give a meaningful name to whatever file or folder you are adding. (For e.g., if you have written a Deep Learning code on Loan Prediction, then loan_prediction.py is one example of valid name)

<br>

# Guidelines üîë

1. Welcome to this repository, if you are here as open source program participant/contributor.
2. Participants / contributors have to **comment** on issues they would like to work on, and mentors or the PA (Project Administrator) will assign you.
3. Issues will be assigned on a **first-come, first-serve basis.**
4. Participants / contributors can also **open their issues** by navigating to the issue template directory [issue_template](https://github.com/World-of-ML/DL-Simplified/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/dl-simplified_issue_template.md), but it needs to be verified and labelled by a mentor or PA(Project Administrator). Please discuss with the team once before opening your issues. We respect all your contributions, whether it is an Issue or a Pull Request.
5. When you raise a issue, make sure you get it assigned to you, before you start working on that project.
6. Each participant / contributor will be **assigned 1 issue (max)** at a time to work.
7. Participants are expected to follow **project guidelines** and [**coding style**](https://pep8.org/"). **Structured code** is one of our top priority.
8. Try to **explain your approach** to solve any issue in the comments. This will increase the chances of you being assigned.
9. Don't create issues that are **already listed**.
10. Please don't pick up an issue already assigned to someone else. Work on the issues after it gets **assigned to you**.
11. Make sure you **discuss issues** before working on the issue.
12. Pull requests will be merged after being **reviewed** by a mentor or PA.
13. It might take **a day or two** to review your pull request. Please have patience and be nice.
14. Always create a pull request from a **branch** other than `main`.
15. Participants / contributors have to complete issues before the decided Deadline. If you fail to make a PR within the deadline, then the issue will be assigned to another person in the queue.
16. While making PRs, don't forget to **add a description** of your work.
17. Include issue number (Fixes:issuenumber) in your commit message while creating a pull request.
18. Make sure your solution to any issue is better in terms of performance and other parameters in comparison to the previous work.
19. We all are here to learn. You are allowed to make mistakes. That's how you learn, right!.

<br>

# Other points to remember while submitting your work: üìç

We want your work to be readable by others; therefore, we encourage you to note the following:

- If Titanic Survival Prediction is submitted for example, the Folder Name should be "Titanic Survival Prediction" and the File Name as "titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb"
- File extension for code should be `.ipynb`. 
- Strictly use snake_case (underscore_separated) in your file_name, as it will be easy to parse in future using scripts.
- Please avoid creating new directories if at all possible. Try to fit your work into the existing directory structure you have created for your project. If you want to, please contact before doing so.
- The basic project folder should have 2 repositories : Dataset and Model. Dataset should have the related dataset files for project to work and Model should have the program file and other related files concerning the project for ML, DL, CV, NLP enthusiasts.
- The [README.md](https://github.com/World-of-ML/DL-Simplified/blob/main/.github/readme_template.md) file should be concise and clear about what the project is about and what it does.
- It should be documented briefly enough to let readers understand. 
- If you have modified/added code work, make sure that algorithm works before submitting.
- If you have modified/added documentation work, ensure your language is concise and contains no grammar errors.
- For front end designers, back end developers and UI/UX designers follow the project structure mentioned in [README]
- Do not update the [README.md](https://github.com/World-of-ML/DL-Simplified/blob/main/.github/readme_template.md) and [Contributing_Guidelines.md](https://github.com/World-of-ML/DL-Simplified/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Avoid importing external libraries for basic algorithms (based on Time Complexity). Only use those libraries for complicated algorithms. **Usage of NumPy is highly recommended.**
