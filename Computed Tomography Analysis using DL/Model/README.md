# Computed Tomography Analysis using DL

## üéØ Goal

The primary objective of this project is to accurately classify medical diseases including tumors, cancer, and aneurysms from CT scan images by applying deep learning algorithms. The goal is to make it easier for medical practitioners to diagnose and treat patients.

## üßµ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed via the following link: [Computed Tomography (CT) of the Brain Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trainingdatapro/computed-tomography-ct-of-the-brain).
