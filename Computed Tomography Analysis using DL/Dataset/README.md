# CT Brain Object Detection Dataset

## Overview
The CT Brain Object Detection Dataset is a comprehensive collection of CT brain scans aimed at facilitating research in neurology, radiology, and oncology. It comprises images of brains afflicted with various conditions such as cancer, tumor, and aneurysm. These scans are invaluable resources for developing and assessing computer-based algorithms, machine learning models, and deep learning techniques for automated detection, diagnosis, and classification of brain diseases.

## Dataset Details
- **Format:** The dataset contains CT brain scans in two different formats: .jpg and .dcm (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine).
- **Types of Brain Diseases:** The dataset encompasses three primary types of brain diseases:
  1. Cancer
  2. Tumor
  3. Aneurysm

## Accessing the Dataset
The dataset is stored in the "files" folder, which is further organized into subfolders corresponding to the type of brain disease. Each subfolder contains CT scans of individuals with the respective condition in both .jpg and .dcm formats.


## Commercial Usage
For commercial purposes, the full version of the dataset offers a more extensive collection of brain scans featuring individuals with diverse conditions. To obtain access to the complete dataset, interested parties can submit a request on TrainingData.

## Acknowledgments
We extend our gratitude to TrainingData for providing access to this valuable dataset, which holds significant potential for advancing research and innovation in the field of medical imaging analysis and diagnosis.
