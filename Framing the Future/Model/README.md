## **Framing the Future**

### üéØ **Goal**
The main objective of this project is to predict future frames in a sequence of Moving MNIST dataset using various deep learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM). Each model's architecture and performance are analyzed to determine the most suitable approach for this task.

### üßµ **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the Moving MNIST dataset, which consists of sequences of handwritten digits moving within a frame. Each sequence contains multiple frames, and the goal is to predict the subsequent frames based on the previous ones.
