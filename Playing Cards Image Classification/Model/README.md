## **Playing Cards Image Classification**

### 🎯 **Goal**

The main goal of this project is to classify different playing cards using deep learning models. This involves building and evaluating models to identify various card types from images with high accuracy.

### 🧵 **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/cards-image-datasetclassification). It consists of images of playing cards with labels corresponding to different card types. The dataset includes training, validation, and test splits.

### 🧾 **Description**

This project aims to implement and compare several deep learning models to classify playing cards. It involves preprocessing image data, applying data augmentation techniques, training models such as basic CNNs, AlexNet and EfficientNet and evaluating their performance using accuracy metrics.

### 🧮 **What I have done!**

- Preprocessed the image data by resizing and normalizing images.
- Applied data augmentation techniques to enhance dataset diversity.
- Implemented three models:
  - **Basic CNN**: A simple convolutional neural network with custom architecture.
  - **AlexNet**: A deep convolutional network known for its success in image classification tasks.
  - **EfficientNet**: A family of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) designed for image classification tasks.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy scores.

### 🚀 **Models Implemented**
