The aim of this project is to analyze the sentiments of the tweets made on/against ChatGPT.

## üßµ **Dataset**

Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/charunisa/chatgpt-sentiment-analysis

## üßæ **Description**

Sentiment analysis on ChatGPT tweets involves using NLP to analyze emotions and attitudes expressed in tweets by the language model. It categorizes tweets as good, bad, or neutral, providing insights into the overall emotional tone of the content. However, it may not fully capture nuances like humor and sarcasm. Regular updates improve accuracy in understanding human emotions.

## üßÆ **What I had done!**

The code is an end-to-end sentiment analysis project, covering data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. It utilizes different machine learning models to compare their performance on sentiment analysis tasks.

## üöÄ **Models Implemented**

1. **CNN:** Convolutional Neural Networks, are specialized neural networks for image processing. They automatically learn features from images through layers like convolutional and pooling. They've revolutionized computer vision tasks like object detection and facial recognition.
   
2. **LSTM:** Long Short-Term Memory, is utilized for tweet analysis. It can capture the sequential nature of tweets, retaining context over varying tweet lengths. This enables better understanding of tweet sentiment, topic trends, and user engagement patterns. LSTM's ability to remember long-term dependencies makes it ideal for processing dynamic social media data like tweets.

3. **VADER:** VADER is a sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for social media text like tweets. It measures the polarity of text, capturing both positive and negative sentiment as well as the intensity of emotions expressed. When applied to ChatGPT-based tweets, VADER can help analyze the emotional tone of the generated text, providing insights into the sentiment conveyed.
