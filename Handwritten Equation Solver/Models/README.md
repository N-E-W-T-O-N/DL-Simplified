The comparison plot above shows the performance of the CNN, and RNN models in recognizing math characters. 

----

The notebook `Notebook.ipynb` covers the following topics:

- Data Loading and Preprocessing: Includes steps to load and preprocess the dataset, such as resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting data.
- CNN Model Training: Contains code for building, training, and evaluating the CNN model.
- RNN Model Training: Contains code for building, training, and evaluating the RNN model.
- Model Evaluation: Includes metrics and visualization for evaluating the performance of both models.
- Experiments: Allows for experimentation with different architectures, hyperparameters, and preprocessing techniques.
