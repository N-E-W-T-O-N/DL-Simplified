## Handwritten Equation Solver using DL - Streamlit Application 


### Overview 

The Handwritten Equation Solver is a Streamlit-based web application that leverages deep learning models to recognize and solve handwritten mathematical equations. Users can draw or write equations freehand on a canvas within the application, and the model will process the input to provide real-time solutions.

### üìù Features
- Interactive Drawing Canvas: Users can draw or write mathematical equations directly on the canvas using their mouse or touchscreen.
- Adjustable Stroke Width: Allows users to adjust the width of their drawing strokes for better accuracy.
- Real-Time Updates: The canvas updates in real-time to reflect the user's input.
- Equation Prediction: A prediction button processes the drawn equation, recognizes individual characters, and solves the equation.
- Visual Feedback: Displays the recognized equation and its solution along with bounding boxes around detected characters.
