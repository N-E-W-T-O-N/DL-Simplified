# **Almond Varieties**

Almond varieties named Ak, Nurlu, Kapadokya and Sıra collected from different regions of Turkey were used in the study. To capture images of the almonds, a special chamber with homogeneous lighting was designed. The Ak, Nurlu and Sıra almond varieties are grown in the Datça district of Muğla in the Aegean region of Turkey, while the Kapadokya almond is grown in Nevşehir in Central Anatolia. Both regions have suitable climate and soil properties for almond cultivation. A total of 1556 images of the four varieties were captured.
