# **Almond Varieties Image Classification**

This project aims to classify different varieties of almonds using state-of-the-art deep learning models. The models implemented in this project are InceptionV3, VGG19, and ResNet50. These models are well-known for their performance in image classification tasks.

### Models Implemented
- **InceptionV3**
InceptionV3 is a convolutional neural network architecture from the Inception family, originally introduced by Google. It employs a technique called "factorized convolutions" to reduce computational cost while maintaining high accuracy. InceptionV3 is known for its efficiency and accuracy in image classification tasks.

- **VGG19**
VGG19 is a deep convolutional neural network architecture from the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford. It has 19 layers and is characterized by its simplicity, using only 3x3 convolutional layers stacked on top of each other in increasing depth. VGG19 is known for its excellent performance on image recognition tasks.

- **ResNet50**
ResNet50 is a deep residual network introduced by Microsoft Research. It consists of 50 layers and uses residual learning to tackle the vanishing gradient problem, making it easier to train deeper networks. ResNet50 is renowned for its high accuracy and robustness in various image classification challenges.

### Libraries Used
The following libraries were used to implement the models:

- TensorFlow: An open-source library developed by Google for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning.
- Keras: A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow.
- NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, used for handling arrays and performing mathematical operations.
- Pandas: A data manipulation and analysis library for Python.
- Matplotlib: A plotting library for Python and its numerical mathematics extension, NumPy.
