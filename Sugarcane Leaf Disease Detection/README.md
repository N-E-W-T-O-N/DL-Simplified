### üéØ **Goal**

The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying different diseases in sugarcane leaves.

### üßµ **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is the Sugarcane Leaf Disease Dataset. It can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nirmalsankalana/sugarcane-leaf-disease-dataset).

### üßæ **Description**

This project involves classifying sugarcane leaf diseases using various machine learning models. The dataset comprises images of sugarcane leaves, categorized into different types. The project utilizes image preprocessing, data augmentation, and ensemble learning techniques to enhance model accuracy.

### üßÆ **What I had done!**

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Loaded the dataset and explored its structure.
   - Understanding the distribution of the samples in the dataset through visualization.

2. **Data Splitting:**
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets using a ratio of 60:20:20.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Resized images to a uniform size.
   - Applied data augmentation techniques like rotation, zoom, and flip to increase the diversity of the training data.

4. **Model Development:**
   - Built and trained a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) model using Keras.
   - Trained 3 pre-trained models such as VGG16, IncepetionV3 and MobileNetV2.
   - To get the best out of the models, I implemented an ensemble learning approach to combine the predictions of multiple models.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
