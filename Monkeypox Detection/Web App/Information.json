    "Description": "Monkeypox is a viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus, similar to smallpox but less severe. It was first identified in monkeys in 1958 and humans in 1970, primarily affecting central and west African regions.",
    "Causes": "The monkeypox virus spreads from animals to humans via direct contact with an infected animal's blood, fluids, or lesions. Human-to-human transmission occurs through respiratory droplets, direct contact with body fluids or lesions, and contaminated materials.",
    "Symptoms": "Monkeypox symptoms start with fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, back pain, muscle aches, and fatigue. A rash appears within a few days, beginning on the face and spreading, progressing from flat lesions to raised bumps, blisters, and pustules before crusting over.",
    "Treatment": "There is no specific cure for monkeypox. Treatment focuses on symptom relief and preventing complications. Supportive care includes hydration and pain management. Smallpox vaccination can prevent monkeypox, and antiviral medications like tecovirimat are used in some cases."
