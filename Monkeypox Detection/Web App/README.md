# Monkey Pox Detection Web Application üíª

## Overview üîç

This web application is designed for detecting Monkey Pox using machine learning models. It provides users with a simple interface to upload images along with their name, and then predicts whether the image contains Monkey Pox or not. Additionally, the application provides information about Monkey Pox, including its description, causes, symptoms, and treatment. The application is built using Streamlit, an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science projects.

## Features

- **Upload Images**: Users can upload images along with their name directly through the web interface.
- **Monkey Pox Detection**: The uploaded images are processed using pre-trained machine learning models to detect Monkey Pox.
- **Information Display**: Users receive information about Monkey Pox, including its description, causes, symptoms, and treatment.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The web application features a simple and intuitive user interface for seamless interaction.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/abhisheks008/DL-Simplified.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```
   cd DL-Simplified/Monkey\ Pox\ Detection/Web\ App
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Streamlit application.
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

1. Open the web application in your browser.
2. Enter your name in the designated field.
3. Click on the "Choose File" button to upload an image and upload it.
4. Wait for the prediction result to appear on the screen, indicating whether Monkey Pox is detected or not.
5. If Monkey Pox is detected, the application provides information about Monkey Pox, including its description, causes, symptoms, and treatment.
6. Return back to upload additional images or repeat the process as needed.
