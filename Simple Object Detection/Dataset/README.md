# Simple Object Detection Dataset

## Overview

This dataset contains images and corresponding annotations for a simple object detection task. The goal of the task is to detect and localize objects within the images. The dataset is intended for educational purposes and small-scale experiments in object detection.

## Content

The dataset consists of the following components:

1. **Images**: The dataset contains a collection of images in JPEG format. These images serve as the input for the object detection task. Each image may contain one or more objects of interest.

2. **Annotations**: Annotations are provided in XML format using the PASCAL VOC format. Each annotation file corresponds to an image and contains information about the objects present in the image, including their class labels and bounding box coordinates.

## Data Format

### Images

The images are stored in the `images` directory. Each image is named with a unique identifier and has the `.jpg` file extension.

### Annotations

The annotations are stored in the `annotations` directory. Each annotation file is named to match the corresponding image file and has the `.xml` file extension. The XML files follow the PASCAL VOC format and contain the following information for each object in the image:

- Object class label
- Bounding box coordinates (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)

## Usage

This dataset can be used for various tasks related to object detection, including:

- Training and evaluating object detection models
- Experimenting with different object detection algorithms and techniques
- Educational purposes, such as learning about computer vision and deep learning
