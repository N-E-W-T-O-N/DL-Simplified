## **Simple Object Detection**

### üéØ **Goal**

The primary objective of this project is to analyze and experiment with object detection techniques using a simple dataset. The aim is to explore different models and algorithms for object detection tasks and compare their performance.

### üßµ **Dataset**

The dataset used for this analysis is the [Simple Object Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kishanj/simple-object-detection/data), available on Kaggle. It comprises images and annotations for a simple object detection task.

### üßæ **Description**

This project involves analyzing the Simple Object Detection Dataset to understand the characteristics of the data, preprocess it for training, implement various object detection models, and evaluate their performance. The focus is on exploring different neural network architectures and techniques for object detection.

### üßÆ **What I had done!**

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Loaded the dataset, examined the images and annotations, and understood the structure of the data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepared the data for training by resizing images, encoding annotations, and splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.
3. **Model Implementation**: Implemented various object detection models including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
4. **Training and Evaluation**: Trained the models on the training data, evaluated their performance on the validation set, and compared their accuracy and speed.
5. **Visualization**: Visualized the predictions made by the models on sample images to understand their effectiveness in detecting objects.
6. **Performance Comparison**: Compared the performance of different models based on metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP), accuracy, and inference speed.
